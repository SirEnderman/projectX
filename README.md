### This is my Class 12 CS project, along with Priyansh Mishra and Rithwik Anand. Platinum is a Machine Learning Program that uses the Na√Øve-Bayes Classification Algorithm to assess the risk of heart failure and liver disease.

### Disclaimer
Platinum aims to educate on the applications of Machine Learning in Medicine. We are not doctors. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns.

## How to use
### The easy way
#### Step 1. Click on the Google Colaboratory link on the right side of the repository.
